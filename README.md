## Setup
This setup assumes you're familiar with the basics of Solana development. 
If you're not, you might find it useful to follow the instructions here: https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld 
and/or here: https://docs.solana.com/cli to get set up with node and rust as well

### get rust
```
sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config build-essential python3-pip jq
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup component add rustfmt
rustup default nightly
rustup component add rust-src
```

### get mango
```
VERSION=v1.6.4
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/$VERSION/install)"
sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev libudev-dev
cargo install spl-token-cli

git clone git@github.com:blockworks-foundation/mango.git
git clone git@github.com:blockworks-foundation/mango-client-ts.git
```


### get devnet coins
- Go to mango-client-ts/src/ids.json and create a token account in [sollet.io](http://sollet.io) for each of the symbols under devnet
- Go to [https://spl-token-ui.netlify.app/#/token-faucets](https://spl-token-ui.netlify.app/#/token-faucets),
- switch to devnet cluster in top right and `Token airdrop` tab
- then copy paste the faucet id for the token you want from ids.json.devnet.faucets
- paste in your corresponding token account address
- hit `Airdrop tokens` and check your [sollet.io](http://sollet.io) to see if you've received tokens

### deploy devnet
Note: Make sure the IDS_PATH and KEYPAIR are correct in mango/cli/devnet.env

Then set the devnet keys and URL
```
source cli/devnet.env
solana config set --url $CLUSTER_URL
```

Then compile program and deploy using devnet_deploy.sh in mango/cli
```
cd cli
. devnet_deploy.sh
```

### deploy mainnet
Rework devnet_deploy.sh and use cli/mainnet.env to deploy to mainnet
